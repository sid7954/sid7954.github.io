## Software projects

Most of my software projects can be found on Github: {% include _icons/github.html username=site.github_username %}.

### academic

Academic is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme that I created for my [blog](https://sociologs.com) and for this website.

Code source available on [Github](https://github.com/gaalcaras/academic/).

### mailingListScraper

A Python tool created during my PhD, `mailingListScraper` can retrieve mailing list archives, organizing the data and metadata as a database.
It's well suited for mailing lists that contain a very big number of emails (several millions).

Code source available on [Github](https://github.com/gaalcaras/mailingListScraper/).
