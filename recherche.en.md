## Digital sociology

### PhD thesis (2016-...)

*Making the source code. A social history of `git` from 1995 to present time* (temporary title). Advisors: [Emmanuel Didier](http://epidapo.ucla.edu/people/emmanuel-didier-phd)  and [Christophe Prieur](http://ses.telecom-paristech.fr/en/membres/christophe-prieur/).

> By tracking the elaboration of [git](https://git-scm.com/), a collaboration tool designed by and for programmers to collaborate on source code, I study the interactions between digital devices ([*dispositifs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispositif)), their makers and their users.
> Issues about the legitimity of code, the differenciated attitudes towards programming and the management of digital work are central topics of my subject.

> I use the traditional methods of the social sciences (archive, field study and statistics) and newer methods enabled by digital tools ("big data", digital ethnography).

### Journal RESET (2016-...)

I am a member of the Editorial Board of [RESET](http://reset.revues.org/) (Social science research on the Internet).

## Sociology of education

In collaboration with [Pablo Zamith](https://pablozamith.squarespace.com/) (a fellow PhD student at [MaxPo](http://www.maxpo.eu/)), I study the recruitement of students at the ENS of Paris, one of France top [*grandes Ã©coles*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandes_%C3%A9coles).
Based upon an original survey of the school archives, we are researching how the recruitement impacts the students' carriers using Regression Discontinuity Design.
