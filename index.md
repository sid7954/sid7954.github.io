I recently graduated with a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in May 2020. I completed my Masters Thesis under the guidance of Prof. Yingyu Liang on representation learning paradigms and their application to text classification. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay in August 2018 where I was advised by Prof. Sunita Sarawagi.
