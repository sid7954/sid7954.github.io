### About Me

I am an Applied Scientist II at Amazon working in the Alexa AI Search team on open-domain Question Answering systems in the Bay Area, CA. I joined Amazon in June, 2020 after graduating from the University of Wisconsin Madison in May, 2020.

I obtained my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I was guided by Prof. Yingyu Liang on Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I worked on Transfer Learning and Adversarial NLP.

I pursued my summer internship as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Alexa Search, Manhattan Beach, CA where I was guided by Alessandro Moschittti. My work involved developing an efficient technique for using pre-trained transformers like BERT for Answer Sentence Selection in Question-Answering.

I completed my Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with Honors from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India in 2018 with a CGPA of 9.59/10. I completed a Minor in Applied Statistics and Informatics during my Bachelors.
