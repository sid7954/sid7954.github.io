### About Me


I am a Senior Research Engineer at Meta Reality Labs working in the Smart Glasses Language AI team. I joined Meta in October, 2023. My current research interests revolve around the training and alignment of large language models (LLMs) for downstream generative tasks like Question Answering. 

Before this, I was working as an Applied Scientist II at Amazon Alexa AI on LLMs and Question Answering systems. My work there was focussed towards improving answer ranking and answer generation models for Open Domain Question Answering, and building automatic Question Answering evaluation systems. I joined Amazon in June, 2020 after graduating from the University of Wisconsin Madison in May, 2020.

I obtained my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I was guided by Prof. Yingyu Liang on Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I worked on Transfer Learning and Adversarial NLP.

I pursued my summer internship as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Alexa Search, Manhattan Beach, CA where I was guided by Alessandro Moschittti. My work involved developing an efficient technique for using pre-trained transformers like BERT for Answer Sentence Selection in Question-Answering.

I completed my Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with Honors from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India in 2018 with a CGPA of 9.59/10. I completed a Minor in Applied Statistics and Informatics during my Bachelors.
