### About Me

I am a second year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing my Masters in Computer Science. I am working with Prof. Yingyu Liang on Natural Language Processing. In specific, I am working on Transfer Learning and Adversarial NLP.

I pursued my summer internship as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Alexa, Los Angeles where I was guided by Alessandro Moschittti. My work involved developping a new technique for using pre-trained transformer models for answer sentence selection in Question-Answering.

I completed my Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with Honors from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India in 2018 with a CGPA of 9.59/10. I completed a minor in Applied Statistics and Informatics during my Bachelors.
